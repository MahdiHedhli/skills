# Remote-client integration boundaries

Verified against NousResearch/hermes-agent `81f481b2db39e9c3e3df8cbb063931746263eca2` (2026-09-28). These are code-path observations for extension authors, not promised plugin APIs. Recheck the version a client actually runs.

## Bot lifecycle

A Hermes profile is the bot's persistent home, but creating a profile alone does not complete the Bot Mode lifecycle. The [Bot Mode guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/bot-mode) and [Profiles guide](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/profiles) describe roster presentation and the canonical Bot Chat. Desktop's flow uses `profiles.create`, stores presentation metadata, then calls `session.create` and `session.title` for the hidden `Bot Chat` (`apps/desktop/src/plugins/hermes-bots/create-dialog.tsx`, `canonical-chat.ts`). The session is lazy until title or first activity persists it; the title can race another creator, so Desktop adopts the existing winner. `tui_gateway/methods_session.py` owns those RPCs. A gateway platform plugin should not assume it can call them in-process, or equate a newly created profile with a usable canonical chat.

The profile-scoped API server has `GET /api/sessions?title=Bot Chat&include_hidden=1` and `POST /api/sessions` with a title; the latter does not atomically apply hidden and profile-following state. `hermes peer dm` uses the lookup/create pair and treats a title conflict as a possible hidden existing chat. Do not equate these lower-level routes with an idempotent Bot Mode create-or-get contract. The API server does not expose profile create/delete; those live in Desktop's TUI gateway/dashboard and the profile CLI. Check all of creation, canonical-chat identity, and partial-failure recovery before adding a remote bot lifecycle UI.

`hermes_cli/profiles.py::delete_profile` removes the profile's config, memories, sessions, and skills, may stop profile backends, and can report that identity settlement is still pending after the directory is gone. The default profile is protected. A remote delete surface needs exact profile identity, owner authorization, an explicit destructive confirmation, and a result that distinguishes complete deletion from settlement pending. Treat a lost delete response as uncertain; read state before offering another attempt. Do not expose a generic shell or profile-path argument to the client.

The API server already provides session list/read, metadata PATCH, DELETE, and `/fork` on a profile. `/fork` ends the source session; it is not a non-destructive branch. Keep canonical Bot Chat deletion/archive outside a generic remote session-management UI, and treat project move/export/open-in-terminal as separate capabilities to verify rather than inferring them from the existing session routes.

## Exact-build plugin qualification

HMP's compatibility gates cover selected Hermes source files. For a git
installation, require both the reviewed file fingerprint and exact commit
SHA. A read-only source archive can prove its bytes match a clean checkout,
but it has no git identity; do not add a fingerprint-only archive entry just
because the git checkout passed. Run Hermes tests through
`scripts/run_tests.sh` and plugin integration against temporary homes.

The HMP fixture extractor pinned Python 3.11, while Hermes `8afaab37` needed
Python 3.14 for its locked dependencies. Select the interpreter from the
target build's package workflow and keep generated environments outside the
live Hermes home. Build the plugin wheel and inspect its contents when a
runtime gate reads package data; source-tree tests can miss an omitted JSON
allowlist or manifest.

## Profile model and credentials

`hermes_cli/web_routers/profiles.py::_write_profile_model` validates a provider/model choice and writes under the selected profile's config and secret scope; it is an internal helper. `hermes_cli/inventory.py::build_model_options_payload` backs `GET /api/model/options`, including authenticated choices. A custom provider's picker row can use the bare slug while persisted config reports `custom:<slug>`; use its aliases or normalize deliberately when showing the selected row. Keep credentials, endpoint URLs, and raw config out of a remote picker response. Gate internal writer use to a qualified build and test profile A → B → A, including which profile's credential validates each write. Do not replace Hermes's validation with a client-side allowlist.

## Search and approval privacy

`hermes_state_search.py::search_messages` currently logs the raw search query on a slow call (`query=%r`, up to 200 characters). A remote search UI can therefore place private user text into host logs even if the plugin never logs it. Check the target build's logging path before exposing search; an upstream fix or a reviewed, version-qualified mitigation is needed.

Approval and clarify waits use Hermes's own profile-scoped timeouts: `approvals.timeout` (default 300 seconds) and `agent.clarify_timeout` (default 3600 seconds). A client-side timer does not own the pending decision; `api_server_runs.py` can return `409 approval_not_pending` for a late answer. Bind a remote answer to the authorized device and exact pending request, deny access to gateway control paths, bound observation resources, and avoid logging answer text. An approval integration must observe Hermes's pending state rather than infer it from elapsed time alone.
